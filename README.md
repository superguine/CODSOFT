### Below, youâ€™ll find a comprehensive list of tasks along with their descriptions, which have been assigned to me by [CODSOFT](https://www.codsoft.in/) for my **_JAVA Programming_** internship.

********************************************************************************************************************************
**[TASK 1 ->  NUMBER GAME](https://github.com/superguine/CODSOFT/blob/main/NumGame.java)**

1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
   >NOTE** here I have provided corresponding feedbacks on whether the guess is -
   >- **correct** -> _Congrats !! You have guessed the correct number_.
   >- **too high** -> _You have guessed a higher number_.
   >- **too low** -> _You have guessed a Lower number_.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.  return

**You can incorporate additional details as follows:**

5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

- ****instruction for the user****
   - After **compile** & **run**
      - user have to guess a number between the given range ( will be displayed ) until correct or all attempts taken.
      - then, if the user wants to play another round ( will be asked ), have to enter `yes` otherwise `no`.

1. **Input:** Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
2. **Calculate Total Marks:** Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
3. **Calculate Average Percentage:** Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
4. **Grade Calculation:** Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
5. **Display Results:** Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
<pre>


</pre>
- ****Instruction for the user****
   - After **compile** & **run**,
      - Users need to enter an integer representing the number of subjects they want to work with.
      - Next, users should enter each subject one by one.
      - Finally, the user should enter marks corresponding to each subject.

## **[TASK 3 -> ATM INTERFACE](https://github.com/superguine/CODSOFT/blob/main/atm.java)**

1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
